<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Water is one of the most important natural resources on Earth and is essential for all forms of life. It covers about three-fourths of the Earth’s surface and is found in rivers, lakes, oceans, and underground sources. Water is needed for drinking, cooking, cleaning, agriculture, and industrial activities. All living beings—plants, animals, and humans—depend on water to survive and grow. It also helps regulate the Earth’s climate and supports the water cycle through evaporation, condensation, and rainfall. Without water, life on Earth would not be possible.</p>
<h3>How water plays a role to us ?</h3>
<p>Water is the invisible thread that weaves through every aspect of human existence, far beyond the simple act of quenching thirst. It is the silent engine of our biology, making up about 60% of the adult human body to regulate temperature, cushion joints, and transport nutrients. Culturally, it is a universal symbol—used to bless in Christian baptisms, purify in Islamic ablutions, and heal in the Hindu belief of the Ganges. Economically, it sustains our world, irrigating the fields that grow our food and cooling the data centres that power the internet. Even in moments of peace, we seek it out; the rhythmic crash of waves lowers cortisol, and the stillness of a lake can quiet a restless mind. Yet for all its abundance, water remains deeply unequal—millions walk miles for what others waste in seconds. It is not merely a resource we use, but a presence we live within.</p>
